```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

On most *nix systems, the file `data/` contains a bunch of words. On my machine, it contains `r sum(hist_dat$n)` words.
I computed the length of each word, i.e. the number of characters, and tabulated how many words consist of 1 character, 2 characters, etc.
The most frequent word length is `r with(hist_dat, word_len[which.max(n)])`.
Here is a histogram of word lengths.
